    "\n",
    "Every definition of a function starts with the *function signiture*. This is initiated with the keyword `def`, followed by the name of the function and the definition of possible arguments in round brackets. Subsequent follows the indented *body* of the function, consisting of at least one command.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After a function is defined, it can be called. It is important to use the round brackets, even if the function does not need any argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hello_word()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions always return a value. This value can be defined with the keyword `return`. If no return value is defined, the function returns [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/constants.html#None).\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def hello_world_string():\n",
    "    return 'hello_world'\n",

    "    return \"ham\", \"spam\", \"eggs\"\n",
    "\n",

    "w1, w2, w3 = give_words()  # Directly unpackes the tuple in its three elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To document (so to describe in words, what the function does and how one uses it) a function one writes a so-called *docstring*. This is a string in the beginning of the body. Usually a multiline string is used, framed by three quotation marks `\"\"\"` on each side. This string is returned by the [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hello_world_string():\n",

    "Functions are used to execute a once defined sequence of tasks with a set of data, which can be different from execution to execution. This data is passed to the function via arguments. The arguments are given in the round brackets in the function signature. For python, arguments do not have a set type, it can change during the runtime of the program. The language is dynamically typecasted.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyword arguments\n",
    "Arguments can also be passed as `key=value` pair (*keyword argument*). This enhances the readability of the code and the order of arguments can be neglected. All arguments, that are not passed with a keyword, are called *positional arguments*.\n",
